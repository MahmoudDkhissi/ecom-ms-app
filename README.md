# Billing Microservices Platform

## General Description

This platform consists of **3 main interconnected microservices**:

1. **Customer Service** – manages customers
2. **Inventory Service** – manages products
3. **Billing Service** – manages bills and product items, combining customer and product data

In addition to these three microservices:

* **Discovery Service (Eureka)** – service registry for dynamic service discovery
* **Reactive Gateway** – single entry point for external clients, with dynamic routing to microservices

Each microservice has its own **H2 database** and exposes a **Spring Data REST Repository** for simple CRUD operations.

```

### Details

* **Reactive Gateway**:
    * Routes requests to microservices via `lb://service-name`
    * Exposes microservice endpoints to external clients

* **Discovery Service (Eureka)**:
    * All microservices register with Eureka
    * Allows the **Gateway** and other services to dynamically discover available instances

* **Billing Service** fetches:
    * the customer from Customer Service via FeignClient
    * the products from Inventory Service via FeignClient

* FeignClients are protected by **Resilience4j Circuit Breakers** to handle service unavailability.

---

## Technologies Used

* Java 17+
* Spring Boot 3.2.5
* Spring Web, Spring WebFlux (Reactive Gateway)
* Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST
* OpenFeign for inter-service calls
* Resilience4j (Circuit Breaker)
* H2 Database (in-memory)
* Eureka Discovery Service
* Springdoc OpenAPI / Swagger (automatic documentation)
* HAL + JSON (HATEOAS)

---

## Running the Services

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven

### Steps

1. Start **Eureka Discovery Service**

```bash
cd discovery-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. Start **Customer Service**

```bash
cd customer-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. Start **Inventory Service**

```bash
cd inventory-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Start **Billing Service**

```bash
cd billing-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

5. Start **Gateway Reactive**

```bash
cd gateway
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

* Services automatically register with **Eureka**
* The **Gateway** dynamically routes requests using `lb://service-name`

## API and Gateway Routing

### Example routes defined in the Gateway :

| Route                  | Target Service     | Description       |
|------------------------| ----------------- |-------------------|
| `/api/bills/**`        | Billing Service   | CRUD bills        |
| `/customers/**`        | Customer Service  | CRUD customers    |
| `/products/**`         | Inventory Service | CRUD products     |
| `/api/productItems/**` | Billing Service   | CRUD ProductItems |

* REST endpoints of each microservice remain accessible via the Gateway (port 8888).

---

## Resilience – Circuit Breaker

* **Billing Service** uses **Resilience4j Circuit Breaker** on the FeignClients for Customer and Inventory.
* Each fallback provides default data:

    * **Default Customer** if Customer Service is down
    * **Default Product** if Inventory Service is down
* This allows Billing Service to continue responding even if a dependent service fails.

---

## Main Models

### Bill

* `id`
* `customerId`
* `name`
* `description`
* `productItems` (list of ProductItems)
* `customer` (Customer fetched via FeignClient)

### ProductItem

* `id`
* `productId`
* `quantity`
* `product` (Product fetched via FeignClient)
* `bill` (reference to the Bill)

### Customer

* `id`
* `name`
* `email`

### Product

* `id`
* `name`
* `description`
* `price`
* `discount`

# Centralized Configuration – Spring Cloud Config Server

The platform uses **Spring Cloud Config Server** to externalize and centralize configuration for all microservices.

---

## Why Centralized Configuration?

* Avoid configuration duplication across services
* Centralize configuration management
* Support multiple environments (`dev`, `prod`, etc.)
* Version configuration using Git
* Enable dynamic configuration refresh without restarting services

---

## Configuration Repository

Configuration files are stored in a Git repository:
```
config-repo/
├── billing-service.properties
├── customer-service.properties
├── inventory-service.properties
├── application.properties
```

⚠️ File names **must match** the value of `spring.application.name`.

---

## Architecture Overview
```
        [ Git Config Repository ]
                   |
                   v
            [ Config Server ]
                   |
       ------------------------
       |          |           |           
       v          v           v           
      Billing  Customer  Inventory  
```

* All microservices fetch their configuration from the **Config Server**
* Configuration is no longer embedded inside each microservice

---

## Microservice Client Configuration Example

Each microservice imports its configuration from the Config Server:
```properties
spring.application.name=billing-service
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```

---

## Configuration Refresh Strategies

By default, configuration does not refresh automatically after a Git commit. Spring Cloud provides two refresh mechanisms.

### 1️⃣ Manual Refresh with Actuator

**Steps:**

1. Update configuration in the Git repository
2. Commit the changes
3. Trigger refresh manually on a specific service:
```http
POST /actuator/refresh
```

**Characteristics:**

* Refreshes only the targeted microservice
* Requires:
  * Spring Boot Actuator
  * `@RefreshScope` on beans using dynamic configuration
* Useful for development and testing

### 2️⃣ Distributed Refresh with Spring Cloud Bus (Recommended)

Spring Cloud Bus propagates configuration changes to all microservices using a message broker (RabbitMQ or Kafka).

**Flow:**
```
Git Commit
   ↓
Config Server
   ↓
Spring Cloud Bus
   ↓
All Microservices refresh automatically
```

**Trigger refresh once:**
```http
POST /actuator/busrefresh
```

**Characteristics:**

* Asynchronous and scalable
* Suitable for microservices architectures
* Ensures configuration consistency across services
* Avoids manual refresh per service

## 🔐 Security & Identity Management

The platform implements a **stateless security architecture** based on **OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, using **Keycloak** as the Identity Provider.

### 🏗️ Security Architecture Overview

* **Identity Provider (IdP):** Keycloak manages users, roles, and authentication.
* **Authentication Flow:** The **Reactive Gateway** handles the initial authentication. Once authenticated, the user receives a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
* **Resource Servers:** Each microservice (Customer, Inventory, Billing) acts as a **Resource Server**. They independently validate the JWT's signature and expiration using Keycloak's public keys.
* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Access is restricted based on user roles (`ADMIN`, `USER`) defined in Keycloak.



### 🛠️ Key Security Implementations

#### 1. Custom Role Mapping (KeycloakRoleConverter)
By default, Spring Security looks for roles in the `scope` claim. We implemented a custom `KeycloakRoleConverter` to:
* Extract roles from the `realm_access.roles` JSON path in the JWT.
* Map them to Spring Security authorities with the `ROLE_` prefix (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN`).
* Enable method-level security using `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`.

#### 2. Token Propagation (Token Relay)
To maintain security during inter-service communication (e.g., when `Billing Service` calls `Customer Service` via Feign):
* A **Feign Request Interceptor** was created.
* It captures the JWT from the current `SecurityContext`.
* It injects the token into the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of the outgoing request.
* This ensures the downstream service can also verify the user's identity and roles.

### 🚀 How to Test Security

#### 1. Obtain an Access Token
Send a POST request to Keycloak to get a JWT:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/realms/ecom-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=password" \
     -d "client_id=your_client_id" \
     -d "username=your_username" \
     -d "password=*****"
   ```  
#### 2. Call a Secured Endpoint
Use the `access_token` received from Keycloak to call the Gateway. The Gateway will then relay this token to the appropriate microservice:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8888/api/bills" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```
